# Contract tests for bin/ceremony-upgrade (issue #561). Constructed CONSUMER
# trees (ceremony `uses:` lines spread across .github/, plus decoy content
# that names the old version) and a constructed SOURCE tree standing in for
# ceremony at the target tag — a docs-sync manifest, its docs, and a
# CHANGELOG.md whose release headings ARE the ladder the command reads.
#
# Every row that must not write is asserted over a WHOLE-TREE fingerprint
# taken before and after, never over the files the tool would have touched:
# the build this rejects is the one that rewrites the refs, then discovers
# the migration, then refuses (#561's third must-fail build), and a
# per-file assertion is exactly what it passes.
#
# The network is a `curl` stub first on PATH whose DEFAULT MODE REFUSES,
# modelled on test/docs-sync.test.sh's. That default is load-bearing rather
# than decorative: with the stub in place for the whole file, every --source
# row below is a proof that the --source path opens no socket at all.

#
# A RATCHET, NOT A PROOF. The table is carried by the command (#561 G5), so
# nothing keeps it current except a reader remembering — and the note that
# ships without its row is the silent damage the whole command exists to
# prevent. This row re-derives the tag set from the prose and fails when a
# note names a tag no row carries. It scans UNWRAPPED paragraphs, because a
# note whose version and whose "and later" fall on either side of a line
# break is invisible to a line-local grep, and that is exactly the note that
# would be missed.
#
# It cannot prove the scan complete: a note phrased in a way this regex does
# not match passes silently. It can only ensure that the notes it CAN see are
# all covered, which is one direction of the risk and the cheap one.
# availability_tags — every X.Y.Z that docs/CONSUMERS.md declares something
# AVAILABLE at, in the sense G5 names: the literal "available" within the 100
# characters before the version, and "and later" directly after it.
#
# THE 100-CHARACTER WINDOW IS THE ASSERTION, not a tuning knob. Matching on
# "the paragraph contains 'available'" was the first shape of this scan and
# it was wrong in the one way that matters: `docs/CONSUMERS.md`'s Labels
# automation block runs from the 0.3.0 note past the 0.7.7 one without a
# blank line, so a paragraph test read #501's "At `0.7.7` and later" — which
# says where an existing notice PRINTS — as an availability note, purely
# because an unrelated sentence upstream of it used the word.
#
# The text is unwrapped first: a note whose version and whose "and later"
# fall on either side of a line break is invisible to a line-local grep, and
# `0.7.0`'s and `0.1.0`'s are both exactly that (which is why #561's own body
# counts ten notes where an unwrapped scan finds more).
#
# One note is deliberately not a row, and bin/ceremony-upgrade's table
# comment names it: #501's 0.7.7, excluded by this window, and by #561's
# happy path moving 0.7.6 -> 0.7.7 and requiring it to succeed.
#
# #559's was the other, and the 0.7.8 cut ended that: its "available at
# **unreleased** and later" had no tag to key a row on, the release cleared
# the marker to `0.7.8`, and this scan found the tag before any row carried
# it — which is the ratchet firing as designed, not a regression.

# --- B8: the CRLF grant refusal names line endings (#600 E8(a)) ------------
#
# A caller written with CRLF endings refuses correctly and always did — the
# value read at the `actions:` line is `read` followed by a carriage return,
# which is not the bare `read` this step rewrites. What shipped was a message
# printing those same four visible bytes on both sides of a sentence saying
# they differ, so the reader is told to compare `actions: read` with
# `actions: read` and find it.
#
# THE FIXTURE IS THE `named` CALLER AND NOT THE BARBERSHOP ONE, which is a
# measured fact about the reach of this reading rather than a fixture
# preference. Barbershop's grant line carries a trailing hand comment, and
# `yaml_uncomment` breaks at the `#` — so the carriage return, which sits after
# that comment, is dropped with it and that caller's value compares equal.
# What CRLF actually reaches is a grant line with nothing after the value,
# which is cast's shape and this one's.
